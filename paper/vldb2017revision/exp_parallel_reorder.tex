\subsection{Parallel Validator Reordering}
In this experiment, we study the benefit of introducing parallelism into validator. Since we have observed that the reordering of the feedback vertex set is the most time consuming subcomponent in validator, we increase the number of threads to parallelize batch reordering as described in Section~\ref{subsec:validator_reordering:parallel}.
