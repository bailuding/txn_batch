\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:experiments}
In our experimental evaluation, we wanted to understand the effect of batching and reordering at storage and validator, the performance of our validator reordering algorithms and policies, parallelizing transaction reordering at validator, and the impact of system configuration parameters. In particular, we asked the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item\vspace{-.8em} How well do our validator reordering algorithms from Section~\ref{subsec:validator_reordering:algorithm} perform? How does batching and reordering at validator using these algorithms affect the end-to-end system performance?
\item\vspace{-.8em} How does the batch size impact performance? 
\item\vspace{-.8em} How does parallel reordering impact the system performance?
\item\vspace{-.8em} How does storage and validator batching and reordering affect the system performance?
\item\vspace{-.8em} How do the different policies presented in Section~\ref{subsec:validator_reordering:policy} impact the system performance?
\item\vspace{-.8em} How does batching and reordering perform on real workloads?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
\label{subsec:experiment:implementation}

%Our system architecture consists of four components: a transaction generator, a processor thread, a storage thread, and a validator thread. The threads communicate through queues of requests; that is, there is a generator queue, a processor queue, a storage queue, and a validator queue.

Our system architecture consists of four components: transaction generation, a processor, storage, and validation. The components communicate through consumer-producer queues.

The transaction generator continuously produces new transactions until the system reaches the maximum permitted concurrency level. The processor multiplexes transactions as a transaction coordinator, receives transaction requests from the transaction generator, sends read/write requests to the storage, sends validation requests to the validator, and replies to the transaction generator. It also restarts aborted transactions; thus, it only communicates commit decisions to the transaction generator. 
The storage continuously processes read and write requests. When storage batching is enabled, it buffers a batch of requests. When processing a batch, it uses the optimal strategy that we discussed in Section~\ref{sec:overview}: It first executes all the write requests in the batch (discarding a write if a newer version exists in the storage), and then all the read requests. 

% validator
The validator performs backward validation. For every transaction, a validation request consists of the keys and versions of its reads and the keys of its writes. The validator caches the write keys of committed transactions in an in-memory hash table, until these writes are overwritten by later updates. When batching is enabled, the validator collects the requests into a batch as they arrive, and runs one of the algorithms from Section~\ref{sec:validator_reordering} to determine a serialization order. Every transaction that passes validation is assigned an integer \emph{commit timestamp}, which corresponds to the version number of the updates it will install in storage. 

% Validator
We have further decoupled the validator component into four subcomponents as described in Section~\ref{subsec:validator_reordering:parallel}. A batch preparation worker receives validation requests from the processor, packages transactions into batches, and queues them for reordering. A transaction reordering worker takes a batch from the queue, pre-validates and filters the transactions in the batch against the validator cache, reorders the transactions, and queues the ordered transactions as a new batch for validation. A validation worker takes a batch from the queue, serializes the transactions, and validates the transactions against the current validator cache, and sends committed transactions to the cache update worker. The cache update worker finally applies updates to the validator cache based on the transaction serialization order. 

% Details of validator implementation.
By default, the validator uses the sort-based greedy algorithm with the \texttt{prod-degree} policy and multi factor 2. To process a batch, we create a dependency graph as described in Section~\ref{subsec:validator_reordering:algorithm}. We have empirically determined that validator reordering is not beneficial if the dependency graph is very dense, as there are fewer opportunities for conflict reduction. Therefore, we heuristically set a limit on the size of the dependency graph. Once we detect that the number of edges has hit this limit during the construction of the dependency graph, we discard the graph and validate the transactions without reordering. 

% Parallelization.
We have parallelized the transaction generation, the storage, and the transaction reordering at the validator. By default, two transaction generators populate the transactions concurrently to supply sufficient load. Two storage workers concurrently process reads and writes, and the writes are applied based on its data versioning as described in Section~\ref{sec:overview}. In the validator, we first introduced pipeline parallelism by processing different subcomponents concurrently. Since we observed that transaction reordering is heavier weight as compared to other subcomponents, we increased its capacity by multi-threading. We used four transaction reordering workers by default.

% Hard ware and data population.
Our system is implemented in Java. All the experiments run on a machine with Intel Xeon E5-2630 CPU @2.20GHz and 16GB RAM. We use a key-value model for the storage, which we implement as an in-memory hash table. In our micro benchmark, we populate the database with 100K objects, each with an 8-byte key. The values are left null as they are not relevant to our evaluation. We generate a transactional workload where each transaction reads 5 objects and writes to 5 objects, with of the reads and one of the writes on the same object. The reads and writes are drawn from a Zipfian distribution, implemented based on the standard model by Gray et al.~\cite{gray1994quickly}. We limit the concurrency level to 300, i.e., at any time there are at most 300 live transactions in the system. The default batch size is 40 for both storage and validator.

% baseline
The baseline configuration represents the system running with both storage and validator batching turned off. We add a batch mode to separate the effect of batching and reordering. In the batch mode, batching is enabled at both storage and validator, but no reordering is performed. The batch mode can benefit from better caching with tighter loops in the processing. 

% other configuration
\eat{The validator uses the sort-based greedy algorithm with the \texttt{prod-degree} policy and multi factor 2.} 

% Misc
All our experimental figures show the averages of 10 runs, each lasting for 60 seconds in between a 10-second warm-up and a 10-second cool-down time. The standard deviation was not significant in any of the experiments, so we omit the error bars for clarity of presentation. We report the good throughput (the number committed transactions per second), the average latency, and the percentile latency.

\subsection{Experiment Summary}

We now summarize the results of our evaluation.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The simple sort-based FVS greedy algorithm strikes a balance between accuracy and time complexity, and leads to the best overall system performance. 
\vspace{-.8em}
\item There is a sweet spot for the batch size, where the system achieves its best combination of throughput, average latency, and percentile latency. We empirically selected the best batch size for our configuration and workload based on the experiment results.
\vspace{-.8em}
\item As we increase the level of parallelism in validator reordering, the throughput, the average latency, and the percentile latency all improve, especially when the data contention is medium to high.
\vspace{-.8em}
\item Batching by itself improves throughput significantly. Adding reordering consistently improves throughput, and significantly reduces the average and the percentile latency. It is always beneficial to use storage reordering. Validator reordering consistently improves the percentile transaction latency but can hurt the throughput and latency when the data contention is at the extremes.
\vspace{-.8em}
\item For alternative reordering policies at the validator, privileging transactions with a metric that combines the degree of the transaction in the dependency graph and its restart time significantly reduces the tail latency.
\vspace{-.8em}
\item Finally, in the Small Bank benchmark, batching and reordering provides significantly better performance with respect to the throughput, the average latency, and the percentile latency as compared to the baseline. 
\vspace{-.8em}
