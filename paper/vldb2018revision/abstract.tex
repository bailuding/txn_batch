	OLTP systems can often improve throughput by \emph{batching} transactions and processing them as a group. Batching has been used for optimizations such as message packing and group commits; however, there is little research on the benefits of a holistic approach to batching across a transaction's entire life cycle.
	
In this paper, we present an OLTP system based on optimistic concurrency control that incorporates batching at multiple stages of transaction execution. 
%Execution batching enables enables reordering of operations to improve performance and reduce conflicts: 
Storage batching enables reordering of transaction reads and writes at the storage layer, reducing \changed{conflicts on the same object}. Validator batching enables reordering of transactions before validation, reducing conflicts between transactions. Dependencies between transactions make transaction reordering a non-trivial problem, and we propose several efficient and practical algorithms that can be customized to various transaction precedence policies such as reducing tail latency. \changed{We also show how to parallelize validator batching for better performance and how to assign transactions to threads for systems without a centralized validator.

In-depth experiments on a research prototype, an open-source OLTP system, and a production OLTP system show that our techniques can  more than triple system throughput and reduce average latency and tail latency by over 80\%.
