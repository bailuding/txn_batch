\section{Conclusions and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusion}
We have shown how to improve transaction performance in an OCC system by integrating batching and reordering into the system architecture at storage and validator. Batching allows the reordering of requests and reduces the number of aborts. We have formulated validator reordering as the problem of finding the minimal feedback vertex set (FVS) in a directed graph, and we have proposed two greedy algorithms for finding a FVS that are flexible and that perform well in practice. We have carried out an extensive experimental study in a main memory transaction processing prototype, as well as on top of a commercial database. Our experiments show that there is a sweet spot for the batch size for the best balance between latency and reordering flexibility. We have also investigated the impact of storage and validator batching on system performance. While both storage and validator batching consistently improve throughput, validator reordering significantly reduces latency profiles. We further proposed a parallel validator design. Our experiments showed that parallel reordering improved  throughput and reduced latency.

In future work, we plan to explore more sophisticated batch creation techniques. We also plan to systematically investigate adaptive batching that intelligently enables batching and adjusts batch sizes to acehive best system performance. As recent open source transaction processing kernels offer impressive
read / write throughput, we also plan to explore the opportunity to incorporate our techniques into those kernels.
