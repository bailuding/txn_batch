\section{Conclusions and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusion}

We have shown how to significantly improve transaction performance in an OCC system through storage and validator batching. Besides clean problem formulations and
reducing validator reordering to the problem of finding the mimimal feedback vertex set (FVS), we proposed two new practical greedy algorithms for this problem
that are fast and that perform well in practice. We showed that our algorithms can integrate different policies into the reordering to optimize for alternative objectives, 
such as low tail latency. We also proposed a parallel validator design to reduce the overhead of reordering. Our extensive experimental study both in a prototype system and also with a commercial database system show that both storage and validator batching consistently improve throughput, and that especially validator reordering 
significantly reduces latency profiles. We also demonstrated how we optimize for low tail latency with alternative policies, and how our parallelization further improves
throughput and reduced latency.

In future work, we plan to explore more sophisticated batch creation techniques. Since we observed a sweet spot forthe  batch size in our experiment, we want to systematically investigate adaptive batching that intelligently adjusts the batch size automatically to achieve the best performance given the workload. As recent open source OLTP kernels offer impressive throughput, we also plan to explore the opportunity to incorporate our techniques into other systems beyond systems that are based on OCC.
